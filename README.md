# Fort Reports Development Notes
The app needs to read and write to the SQLite database stored internally in the app. There are four main pages to the app. Below is a description of each and the database tables it interacts with.

## Setup - Reports & User
Reports page shows a list of all of the report addresses on the left and a form to add/edit report addresses on the right.
User page is a single form that allows the user to edit their profile information and purchase credits.

## Report
This page is the most complicated. This is where the user creates their report. On the left is a list of categories. On the bottom is buttons for each section of the house. Each section has itâ€™s own list of categories. On the right is the list of selections for the selected category, and the details button leads to a second list of selections for the selected category. ![proto](https://content.screencast.com/users/prageer/folders/Default/media/acf4f191-722b-4be7-950c-7e4436b57d32/fort3.png)

## Reports - Camera
Clicking the camera icon on the top right of the reports page  opens the camera window. Users can take up to 4 images for each category. Users can also draw on the image by clicking the draw button and using their finger to draw circles and arrows on the image

## Preview
On this page the user can preview the report they have created . They can see the whole report at once , or click the section buttons at the bottom to preview just that section. The preview will show the images (up to 4) and the report data for each category.
